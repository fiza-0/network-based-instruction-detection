Developing a network-based instruction detection system using Snort involves several steps:

1. Install Snort: Download and install Snort on your system.

2. Understand Snort rules: Learn Snort's rule syntax and structure.

3. Define detection criteria: Identify the instructions you want to detect (e.g., specific byte sequences or packet patterns).

4. Write Snort rules: Create custom rules based on your detection criteria.

5. Configure Snort: Set up Snort to monitor network traffic and alert on rule matches.

6. Test and refine: Test your rules with sample traffic and refine them as needed.

7. Integrate with alerting systems: Forward alerts to a SIEM or other alerting system for analysis and response.
